## Eyecompass
### Description
It is an Android APP based on HUAWEI eyewear, especially for deliverymen who find it challenging and dangerous to navigate using mobile phones. We aim to design an app which can provide some useful hints through eyewear for deliverymen.  

### Effect Acheived
+ When wearer knocks head, then the eyewear can tell the wearer the remaining time until the end time
+ When wearer double clicks the left glasses arm, then the app will switch to navigation model. In this model, the eyewear will first open a website of Gaode Map, and then play voice guiding the wearer should turn right/left now.
+ We also provide a ExitText for users to enter in address and then search it in web.
